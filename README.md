# UwU Script Converter and realtime translator

a Python script designed to convert a source code file into "UwU" language using Python and run the converted scripts realtime

## How it Works

The script employs a predefined mapping dictionary (`mapping`) that pairs Python keywords and identifiers with their corresponding "UwU" equivalents. For instance:
- "import" becomes "impowt"
- "return" becomes "wetuwn"
- "not" becomes "nyot"
- and so forth.

  ### how to use

  1. replace pywopath = 'script.py' and uwupathywathy = 'script.uwu' to whatever script name you want
  2. run python converter.py
  3. run python uwuthon.py script.uwu
